            "IN THE YEAR 2015 , LEADERS FROM 193 COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD CAME TOGETHER TO FACE THE FUTURE . They knew we had enough food to feed the world , but that it wasn ’ t getting shared . This set of 17 goals imagines a future just 15 years off that would be rid of poverty and hunger , and safe from the worst effects of climate change . Present in nearly 170 countries and territories , we help nations make the Goals a reality . Yes , it ’ s an ambitious goal—but we believe it can be done . In 2000 , the world committed to halving the number of people living in extreme poverty by the year 2015 and we met this goal . However , more than 800 million people around the world still live on less than $ 1.25 a day— that ’ s about the equivalent of the entire population of Europe living in extreme poverty . END HUNGER , ACHIEVE FOOD SECURITY AND IMPROVED NUTRITION AND PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE AGRICUL TURE In the past 20 years , hunger has dropped by almost half . But for the sake of the nearly 1 out of every 9 people on earth who go to bed hungry every night , we ’ ve got to try . In the 25 years before the SDGs , we made big strides—preventable child deaths dropped by more than half , and maternal mortality went down by almost as much . And yet some other numbers remain tragically high , like the fact that 6 million children die every year before their fifth birthday , or that AIDS is the leading cause of death for adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa . We have the means to turn that around and make good health more than just a wish.ENSURE INCLUSIVE AND EQUITABLE QUALITY EDUCATION AND PROMOTE LIFELONG LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL First , the bad news on education . Poverty , armed conflict and other emergencies keep many , many kids around the world out of school . Since 2000 , there has been enormous progress on the goal to provide primary education to all children worldwide : the total enrolment rate in developing regions has reached 91 % . By measures in any school , that ’ s a good grade . Now , let ’ s get an even better grade for all kids , and achieve the goal of universal primary and secondary education , affordable vocational training , access to higher education and more.We can celebrate the great progress the world has made in becoming more prosperous and fair . There are still gross inequalities in work and wages , lots of unpaid “ women ’ s work ” such as child care and domestic work , and discrimination in public decision- making . While many people take clean drinking water and sanitation for granted , many others don ’ t . Water scarcity affects more than 40 percent of people around the world , and that number is projected to go even higher as a result of climate change . If we continue the path we ’ re on , by 2050 at least one in four people are likely to be affected by recurring water shortages . But we can take a new path—more international cooperation , protecting wetlands and rivers , sharing water-treatment technologies—that leads to accomplishing this Goal . ENSURE AVAILABILITY AND SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF WATER AND SANITATION FOR ALL ENSURE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE , RELIABLE , SUSTAINABLE AND MODERN ENERGY FOR ALL Between 1990 and 2010 , the number of people with access to electricity increased by 1.7 billion . And yet as the world ’ s population continues to rise , still more people will need cheap energy to light their homes and streets , use phones and computers , and do their everyday business . How we get that energy is at issue ; fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions are making drastic changes in the climate , leading to big problems on every continent . How ’ s that for a balancing act ? PROMOTE SUSTAINED , INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH , FULL AND PRODUCTIVE EMPLOYMENT AND DECENT WORK FOR ALL An important part of economic growth is that people have jobs that pay enough to support themselves and their families . The good news is that the middle class is growing worldwide—almost tripling in size in developing countries in the last 25 years , to more than a third of the population . And in the end we can achieve the goal of decent work for all women and men by 2030.BUILD RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE , PROMOTE INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE INDUSTRIALIZATION AND FOSTER INNOVATION Technological progress helps us address big global challenges such as creating jobs and becoming more energy efficient . And yet four billion people have no way of getting online , the vast majority of them in developing countries . The more we invest in innovation and infrastructure , the better off we ’ ll all be . Bridging the digital divide , promoting sustainable industries , and investing in scientific research and innovation are all important ways to facilitate sustainable development.REDUCE INEQUALITY WITHIN AND AMONG COUNTRIES It ’ s an old story : the rich get richer , and the poor get poorer . That means improving the regulation of financial markets and institutions , sending development aid where it is most needed and helping people migrate safely so they can pursue opportunities . MAKE CITIES AND HUMAN SETTLEMENTS INCLUSIVE , SAFE , RESILIENT AND SUSTAINABLE If you ’ re like most people , you live in a city . More than half the world ’ s population now lives in cities , and that figure will go to about two-thirds of humanity by the year 2050 . The thing is , they ’ re also often centers of extreme poverty . To make cities\n"
